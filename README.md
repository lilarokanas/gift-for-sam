# Welcome to your gift üòä

Hi Sam,
I put together something for you. Here are instructions to view it:

## Installation

Open a Terminal and navigate into a folder you wouldn't mind a random folder living in. You do this with `cd`:

```bash
cd random-folder-name
```

Then clone this repository into that folder.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/lilarokanas/gift-for-sam
```

Navigate into that newly cloned repository, using the same `cd` command as before:
```bash
cd gift-for-sam
```

In your terminal, run the following command to install necessary packages:

```bash
npm install
```

You should now be able to run this application locally via:

```bash
npm run dev
```

A link will be outputted in the terminal. Navigate to it to access the site. 

It should be: http://localhost:5174/

Enjoy! ‚ù§Ô∏è


## Usage

Just follow the directions above. Let me know if there are any issues. 

(I do not recommend looking at the code - it's funky in there.)

P.S. I have no idea if this will totally work. I hope it does. ü§û
